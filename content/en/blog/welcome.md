## Le Plus Grand Nombre launches!

We are excited to introduce **Le Plus Grand Nombre**, our company dedicated to building digital tools for craftsmen.

### Why this project?

The world of craftsmanship is evolving. Craftsmen must juggle their technical expertise with growing administrative demands: quotes, invoices, inventory management, scheduling... We believe technology can and should simplify these tasks so craftsmen can focus on what they do best: their craft.

### Our first application

Our first tool, the **Artisans Manager**, is already available at [artisans.leplusgrandnombre.fr](https://artisans.leplusgrandnombre.fr). It allows you to:

- Manage your projects end to end
- Generate professional quotes
- Track your tools and consumables inventory
- Schedule your interventions

All with the help of artificial intelligence, to save you time.

### What's next

We're already working on new features and new applications. Stay connected by following this blog to discover our upcoming announcements!
